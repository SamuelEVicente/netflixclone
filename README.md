This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was for study purposes. Used it to practice getting data(json) from a third party api and being able to populate a list of data.

If you would like to run the code please get your self an api key from tmdb(the third party api used). You need to create an account to then get an api key. Set up where the website will be running for example mine is running at http://{LocalIP}:3000.
Once you do that just change the apikey with yours.

You should be able to run :)
